# Techdegree-Project-Three
 An Online Registration Form Project

## Strengths
First time using an API Google Font Effect and I love how simple it is to add some spicy design to a project.

### Learning Moments
I put normalize at the **bottom** of the stylesheets. * *facepalm* *

I learned a lot about how flexbox functions. Including having two parent containers. *thank you John Skeen of Treehouse!*
